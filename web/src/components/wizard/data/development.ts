**Task: Diagnose and Fix Bug**

Use this debugging methodology:

1. **Reproduce** - Create minimal test case to consistently trigger the bug
2. **Investigate** - Analyze logs, stack traces, and system behavior
3. **Root Cause** - Identify the underlying issue, not just symptoms
4. **Fix Implementation** - Write targeted fix with minimal side effects
5. **Testing & Prevention** - Verify fix and add tests to prevent regression

**Example Debug Process:**
Issue: User data not saving
Investigation: Check API logs ‚Üí Database connections ‚Üí Validation errors
Root Cause: Race condition in async save operation
Fix: Add proper error handling and retry logic

Provide step-by-step debugging approach, complete fix code, and explain why this solution addresses the root cause. Include tests to prevent this bug from reoccurring.`,

5. **Readability** - Clear naming, proper abstractions, documentation

**Before/After Example:**
// Before: 200-line function with nested loops
// After: 5 focused functions with clear responsibilities
// Improvement: 60% faster, 80% more readable, easier to test

Show concrete before/after code examples. Explain each refactoring decision and its benefits. Ensure the refactored code is easier to understand, test, and maintain while preserving all existing functionality.`,
