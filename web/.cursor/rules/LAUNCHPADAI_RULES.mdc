#ALWAY READ AND AHDERE TO THESE INSTRUCTIONS

- Break down large steps into smaller tasks
- Finish each task in the list
- Do not ask question such as "Shall we?", "Shoud I go forward?". Just do the tasks outlined.
- When you're creating a parent/child route where the parent displays a list of items and then the user clicks on one of the items to navigate to the item detail page, follow these principles:
    - On the parent page use a Tanstack Table whenever possible
    - On the parent page incude an + Add Item button to the top right
    - On the parent page include a Delete Selected button when one or more items are selected from the table rows
    - Always create one route for the child without the item ID
    - Set the item into a Jotail atom at the parent page level
    - On the detail page do not make a DB call to fetch the details, use the atom
    - On the cild page, always include CRUD operations where you update both the atoms and the DB
    - Always use React Server Actions for the mutations
