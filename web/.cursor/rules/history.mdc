### Authentication Flow Improvements
- Fixed Firebase authentication session handling:
  - Updated Firebase client initialization to use proper persistence methods (`indexedDBLocalPersistence` and `browserLocalPersistence`)
  - Refactored the signup flow to properly handle user authentication:
    - Server side: Create user with Firebase Admin SDK
    - Client side: Sign in user to get ID token
    - Send ID token to session API to create proper session cookie
  - Enhanced error logging in the session API endpoint for better debugging
  - Fixed signup redirection to automatically route user to dashboard after successful authentication
  - Improved social sign-in flows to properly set session cookies
  - Separated client and server-side authentication concerns for better security and reliability
